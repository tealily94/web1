  Do you think I care?</a><br>well maybe.
<p>Facing alarming numbers of Covid-19 infections,
   hospitalizations, and deaths, Germany and France
   tightened restrictions on businesses and social life yesterday with the most dramatic measures they have taken since the spring.</p>

  infections under control so businesses can open back up
  sooner. </p>
