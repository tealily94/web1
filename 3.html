<p>Several Russians affiliated with the military intelligence unit the GRU were charged with the hack of the Democrats and the leak of the stolen emails, which shaped politics in the 2016 presidential race and gave Trump's campaign fodder to attack Clinton. Separately, other Russians have been indicted for operating a sprawling social media propaganda campaign intended to destabilize American politics.
Mueller reasoned that Stone and Assange could have been liable for the hacking conspiracy because they had helped to disseminate and maximize the impact of the stolen documents. But ultimately, Mueller wrote, the Justice Department "did not have admissible evidence," such as proof of an agreement and knowledge that the hack was ongoing, to secure conspiracy convictions.</p>
